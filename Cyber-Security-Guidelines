# Cyber Security – Reflection

## 1. Research & Learn

### Common Cyber Security Threats in Remote Work
- **Phishing attacks** via email or chat messages.
- **Malware** from unverified downloads or infected USB devices.
- **Credential theft** through weak or reused passwords.
- **Unsecured Wi-Fi** networks allowing data interception.
- **Social engineering** tactics to trick users into revealing sensitive information.

### Best Practices for Secure Devices & Accounts
- Use **strong, unique passwords** for all accounts.
- Enable **two-factor authentication (2FA)** wherever possible.
- Keep operating systems and software updated.
- Avoid using public Wi-Fi without a VPN.
- Lock devices when away from the desk.
- Use **company-approved apps and tools** for storing and sharing information.

### Importance of Locking Your Computer
- Prevents unauthorised access to company systems or sensitive data when you step away.
- Reduces the risk of accidental changes or misuse by someone else.

### Handling Phishing Attempts & Suspicious Links
- Verify sender identity before clicking any link or opening attachments.
- Look for **spelling errors**, unusual requests, or mismatched URLs.
- Report suspicious messages to the designated IT/security contact immediately.
- Never enter credentials into a site unless you are sure it’s legitimate.

### Strong Password Practices & Password Managers
- A strong password is long (12+ characters), contains a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols, and avoids common words.
- A password manager securely stores and generates strong passwords, reducing reuse and human error.

### Importance of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- Adds a second layer of protection even if your password is compromised.
- Should be enabled on **all work-related accounts** and any account containing sensitive or personal data.

## 2. Reflection

### Current Security Measures I Follow
- Use unique passwords for most accounts.
- Keep my laptop and phone set to auto-lock after a short period.
- Enable 2FA on email and critical work accounts.

### Areas for Improvement
- Move all passwords into a secure **password manager**.
- Avoid using similar passwords across multiple low-priority accounts.

### Making Secure Behaviour a Habit
- Set a weekly reminder to check software updates.
- Always lock the screen when stepping away, even for a minute.
- Be proactive in reporting suspicious activity.

### Steps to Ensure Password & Account Security
- Transfer credentials to a password manager.
- Enable 2FA for all Focus Bear accounts and relevant personal accounts.
- Avoid saving passwords in plain text or browser autofill without encryption.

### What I Would Do if I Suspected a Breach
1. Immediately change passwords for affected accounts.
2. Disconnect from the network if malware is suspected.
3. Notify Focus Bear’s security contact or manager.
4. Follow company’s incident response process.
