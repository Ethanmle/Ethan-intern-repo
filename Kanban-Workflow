# Kanban Workflow – Research & Reflection

## 1. Research & Learn

### How a Kanban Board Works
A Kanban board is a visual workflow management tool that tracks tasks as they move through different stages of completion.  
- Tasks are represented as “cards” and organised into columns that reflect workflow stages.
- The board allows teams to see work in progress, prioritise tasks, and identify bottlenecks.

### Common Kanban Board Columns
| Column        | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| **Backlog**   | Tasks that are identified but not yet started. |
| **In Progress** | Tasks currently being worked on. |
| **Blocked**   | Tasks that cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues. |
| **Done**      | Completed tasks that meet acceptance criteria. |

### How Tasks Move Through the Board
- Tasks start in **Backlog** and are pulled into **In Progress** when someone begins work.
- If work is halted due to a dependency, the task moves to **Blocked** until resolved.
- Once finished and verified, the task is moved to **Done**.
- The **assignee** is responsible for updating the card’s status as progress is made.

### Benefits of Limiting Work in Progress (WIP)
- Prevents team members from juggling too many tasks at once.
- Improves focus and quality by reducing context switching.
- Makes it easier to spot bottlenecks.
- Shortens cycle times and improves delivery speed.

## 2. Reflection

### How Kanban Helps Manage Priorities & Avoid Overload
- Visualising the workflow makes priorities clear at a glance.
- WIP limits ensure only the most important tasks are actively being worked on.
- Bottlenecks are easier to identify, enabling faster problem-solving.

### How I Can Improve My Workflow Using Kanban Principles
- Break larger financial analysis or fundraising tasks into smaller, trackable cards.
- Update card statuses daily to reflect accurate progress.
- Use WIP limits to avoid starting too many grant research or reporting tasks at once.
