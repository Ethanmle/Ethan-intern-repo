# Use of AI Tools – Reflection

## 1. Research & Learn

### AI Tools Commonly Used for My Role
- **ChatGPT / OpenAI** – drafting documents, summarising text, brainstorming.
- **Grammarly** – grammar and clarity checks.
- **Notion AI** – organising notes, summarising meetings.

- **Automation:** Handles repetitive tasks (e.g., formatting, basic research).
- **24/7 availability:** Immediate assistance without waiting for human input.

### Risks of Using AI

- **Over-reliance:** Risk of reduced critical thinking and skill development.

### Information That Should Never Be Entered into AI Tools

- Any health or sensitive personal data.

## 2. Reflection

### When to Use AI vs. Rely on Own Skills
- **Use AI:** For first drafts, brainstorming, summarising long texts, idea generation.
- **Use Own Skills:** For final decision-making, creative judgement, analysis requiring domain-specific knowledge, and confidential communications.

### Avoiding Over-Reliance
- Treat AI as a **co-pilot, not the driver** — always review and edit outputs.
- Continue to **develop core skills** (writing, analysis, problem-solving) independently.

### Ensuring Data Privacy
- Remove or anonymise any sensitive data before using AI.
- Stick to approved AI tools that meet security requirements.
- Follow company guidelines for AI usage.
