# Module 1: Agile Principles & Frameworks

## 1. Research & Learn

### What is Agile & How It Differs from Traditional Project Management
- **Agile:** An iterative, flexible approach to project management focused on delivering value in small increments, adapting quickly to change, and involving stakeholders continuously.
- **Traditional (Waterfall):** A linear, sequential approach where all requirements are defined upfront, and each phase (design, build, test, deliver) is completed before moving to the next.
- **Key Difference:** Agile embraces change at any stage, whereas traditional methods resist scope changes after planning.

### Core Values of Agile (Agile Manifesto)
1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan.

### Core Principles of Agile (examples from the 12 Principles)
- Deliver value early and continuously.
- Welcome changing requirements.
- Collaborate daily between business and technical teams.
- Maintain a sustainable pace of work.
- Reflect and adjust regularly to improve.

### Scrum vs Kanban

| Feature        | Scrum | Kanban |
|----------------|-------|--------|
| **Structure**  | Time-boxed sprints (usually 2–4 weeks) | Continuous flow of work |
| **Roles**      | Defined roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team) | No mandatory roles |
| **Planning**   | Sprint planning & backlog grooming | Continuous prioritisation |
| **Metrics**    | Velocity, burndown charts | Cycle time, throughput |
| **When to Use**| Projects with clear sprint goals, stable teams | Continuous delivery, variable priorities |

### Why Focus Bear Leans Towards Kanban
- Work is **continuous** (no fixed sprint cycles).
- Priorities can change rapidly depending on customer needs or internal goals.
- Smaller team structure doesn’t require formal Scrum roles.
- Kanban provides visual flow, flexibility, and WIP limits without the overhead of sprint ceremonies.

## 2. Reflection

### Benefits of Agile
- **Adaptability:** Can adjust quickly to new requirements.
- **Transparency:** Visual tools (e.g., Kanban board) keep everyone informed.
- **Faster delivery:** Smaller, iterative releases mean value reaches users sooner.
- **Collaboration:** Frequent communication between team members.

### Challenges of Agile
- Requires discipline to keep boards, tasks, and priorities updated.
- Can feel less predictable without fixed long-term timelines.
- Risk of scope creep if priorities constantly shift.

### How Agile Principles Can Improve My Role
- Use **continuous feedback** to refine financial reporting or process automation.
- Prioritise tasks based on value and urgency instead of a fixed list.
- Break large goals (e.g., grant research or financial model building) into smaller, trackable deliverables.

## 3. Task

### Scrum vs Kanban (In My Own Words)
Scrum is like working in short, focused “game rounds” where you agree on what to finish and don’t change the plan until the round ends. Kanban is more like a constantly moving conveyor belt—you can add or remove items anytime, but you limit how many are in progress so nothing gets stuck.

### Agile Principle Most Useful to My Work
**“Responding to change over following a plan.”**  
In finance and grant work, priorities can shift suddenly—funding opportunities pop up, budgets change, or urgent analysis is needed. Being comfortable adapting ensures I deliver value in real time without being slowed by rigid plans.
