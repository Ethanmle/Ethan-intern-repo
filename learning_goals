# Internship Reflection – Learning & Contribution (Finance Intern)

## 1) What do you hope to learn from this internship?
- **Fundraising strategy** end-to-end: prospecting → qualification → application → reporting.
- How to **use AI to streamline the grants process** (prospect discovery, eligibility checks, first-drafting responses, budgeting narratives) while protecting data privacy.

## 2) What skills are you most excited to develop?
- **Technical skills**
- **AI research & prompt engineering:** building reliable workflows and SOPs for grant research/writing.
- **Grants & finance ops:** budgeting for grants, KPI design, compliance tracking.

## 3) What do you think you can contribute to the team?
- Build a **grant pipeline database** (Airtable/Sheets) with scoring (fit, $ size, due date, win-likelihood).
- Create **AI-assisted templates** (eligibility checklist, cover letter, budget narrative) to cut drafting time.
- Stand up a **fundraising KPI dashboard** (e.g., #prospects, submissions, win rate, cycle time).

## 4) One area I feel less confident in that I’d like to improve
- **IT skills:** Git/GitHub basics, working with APIs, light scripting, and secure automation.
  - Plan: complete onboarding in 2 weeks, then move to the list of angel investors

## 5) What does success in this internship look like for me?
- **Tangible outcomes:**  
  - A curated pipeline of **30–50 grant prospects** with **10 prioritized** and at least **2 submissions**.  
  - An **AI-assisted research/writing SOP** that **reduces prep time by ~30–50%**.  
  - (maybe) A live **fundraising dashboard** and monthly finance snapshot used in stand-ups.
- **Skill growth:** demonstrable improvement in scripting + dashboards; confident using AI responsibly.
- **Team impact:** my tools/templates adopted by others; positive feedback from my manager.
- **Process discipline:** all work **tracked in Focus Bear** sessions with clear notes for auditability.
