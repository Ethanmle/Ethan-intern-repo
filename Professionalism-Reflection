## 1. Research & Learn

### Examples of Professional vs. Unprofessional Behaviour in a Casual Work Environment

| Professional | Unprofessional |
|--------------|----------------|
| Responding promptly to messages | Ignoring team communication without explanation |
| Being prepared for meetings | Joining late or unprepared |
| Using respectful, inclusive language | Making dismissive or offensive comments |
| Giving constructive, actionable feedback | Criticising without solutions or attacking the person |
| Owning mistakes and fixing them | Blaming others or hiding issues |
| Meeting deadlines or communicating delays early | Missing deadlines without notice |

---

### Respectful Communication in Remote Teams
- Use a **friendly, clear, and concise tone** in messages.
- When disagreeing, focus on the **idea, not the person**.
- Give feedback with context: “I noticed X; it might work better if we Y.”
- Respond to feedback with curiosity, not defensiveness.
- Always assume **good intent** unless proven otherwise.

---

### Giving & Receiving Feedback Professionally
- **Giving:** Focus on behaviour or deliverables, be specific, offer alternatives.
- **Receiving:** Listen fully, ask clarifying questions, avoid interrupting, thank the person.
- Frame feedback around shared goals.

## 2. Reflection

### Great Teamwork & Professionalism I’ve Witnessed
- Everyone shared updates openly, gave credit to others, and stepped in to help when someone was overloaded.
- The team maintained a positive tone in all interactions, even under pressure.

### Steps for Clear, Respectful, and Inclusive Communication
- Use plain language and avoid jargon unless necessary.
- Confirm understanding with a quick recap or follow-up note.
- Be mindful of cultural and personal differences in tone or communication style.

### Creating a Positive, Fun, and Professional Environment
- Celebrate small wins publicly.
- Use humour appropriately to build rapport without offending.
- Support teammates when they face challenges.

### Preparing for Meetings with Supervisors/Colleagues
- Review the agenda beforehand.
- Have talking points, updates, or questions ready.
- Keep supporting documents or data accessible.

### Being Proactive During My Internship
- Identify and act on tasks without waiting to be told if they clearly align with my responsibilities.
- Share ideas for improvement when I see an opportunity.

### Following Up with Colleagues/Supervisors
- First follow-up: Friendly reminder message after a reasonable wait (1–2 days for urgent, 3–5 days for non-urgent).
- Second follow-up: Escalate politely if no response and work is blocked — explain urgency and impact.
- Escalate further to management or CEO if it involves **major breaches of professional conduct** or critical business risks.

### Things I Won’t Do
- Ignore deadlines without communication.
- Gossip about teammates or share private information.
- Use disrespectful language in any communication.
- Submit incomplete work without flagging gaps.
