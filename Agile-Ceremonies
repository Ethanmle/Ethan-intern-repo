# Agile Ceremonies & Team Collaboration

## 1. Research & Learn

### Main Agile Ceremonies & Purpose

| Ceremony | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Daily Stand-ups** | Short (10–15 min) meeting to share progress, plans, and blockers; keeps the team aligned daily. |
| **Sprint Planning (Scrum)** | Define goals and select tasks for the upcoming sprint; agree on scope and priorities. |
| **Continuous Prioritisation (Kanban)** | Ongoing adjustment of priorities as new work arrives; team pulls work from the top of the backlog when ready. |
| **Retrospectives** | Reflect on what went well, what didn’t, and actions to improve in the next cycle. |
| **Backlog Refinement** | Review, update, and clarify backlog items so they’re ready for upcoming work; ensures tasks are well-defined and prioritised. |

### Asynchronous & Cross-Time-Zone Collaboration in Agile
- Use **shared Kanban boards** or project management tools (e.g., GitHub Projects, Jira, Trello) so work status is visible anytime.
- Document decisions, priorities, and blockers in **written updates** rather than relying only on meetings.
- Use **async stand-ups** (written in Slack, Notion, or similar) when time zones make live meetings difficult.
- Keep communication **concise and context-rich** to reduce back-and-forth delays.
- Record key meetings or provide summaries so absent team members can catch up.

## 2. Reflection

### How Agile Ceremonies Help with Communication & Alignment
- Ensure everyone knows **what’s being worked on, by whom, and what’s blocking progress**.
- Create regular feedback loops to catch issues early.
- Aligns team efforts to the most important business goals.
- Encourages transparency and shared ownership of outcomes.

### Most Important Ceremony for My Role
- **Daily Stand-ups** – As a Finance/Fundraising Intern, I often have dependencies on others for data, approvals, or updates on features linked to budget or grants. Stand-ups give me a fast, structured way to:
  - Flag blockers (e.g., waiting on financial figures or grant application details).
  - Stay aware of team priorities so I can align my financial analysis or research.
