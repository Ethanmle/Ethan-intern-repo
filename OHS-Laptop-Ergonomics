# Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) – Desk-Based Work

## 1. Research & Learn

### Risks of Using a Laptop Without External Equipment
- **Neck strain** from looking down at a low screen.
- **Wrist strain** from typing on a flat laptop keyboard for extended periods.
- **Poor posture** leading to back and shoulder discomfort.
- **Eye strain** due to prolonged close-up focus without breaks.
- **Reduced focus/productivity** from physical discomfort.

### Ergonomic Equipment to Improve Posture
- **Laptop stand or riser** to raise screen to eye level.
- **External keyboard & mouse** to allow proper arm and wrist positioning.
- **Ergonomic chair** with adjustable height, lumbar support, and armrests.
- **Adjustable desk** or sit-stand workstation.
- **Footrest** to support feet if chair height adjustment leaves them hanging.

### Key Setup Adjustments
- **Monitor height:** Top of screen at or slightly below eye level.
- **Chair position:** Feet flat on floor (or footrest), knees at ~90°, hips slightly above knees.
- **Desk height:** Allows elbows to bend at ~90° with forearms parallel to the ground.
- **Screen distance:** About arm’s length from eyes.
- **Lighting:** Reduce glare with natural light or soft desk lamps.

### Daily Habits to Reduce Impact of Prolonged Laptop Use
- **Movement breaks:** Stand and stretch every 30–45 minutes.
- **Posture checks:** Shoulders relaxed, back supported, head aligned with spine.
- **20-20-20 rule for eyes:** Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.
- **Micro stretches:** Gentle neck, shoulder, and wrist stretches throughout the day.

## 2. Reflection

### Equipment Changes I Can Make
- Add a **laptop stand** to bring screen to eye level.
- Use an **external keyboard and mouse** to prevent wrist strain.
- Adjust chair height so feet are fully supported.

### Behavioural Changes I Can Implement
- Take **movement breaks every 30 minutes** (using Focus Bear reminders).
- Do **daily posture checks** before starting each work block.
- Apply the **20-20-20 eye strain rule** during focus sessions.

### How I Can Remind Myself
- **Focus Bear movement prompts** every 30–40 minutes.
- Sticky note on monitor: “Sit tall & shoulders back.”
- Phone reminder for midday stretch session.

## 3. Task Actions

### Workspace Changes Made
- Raised laptop on a stack of books (temporary) to bring screen to eye level.
- Connected external keyboard and mouse.
- Adjusted chair height and positioned back fully against backrest.

### New Habit Implemented
- Using Focus Bear’s **movement break reminders** for a full workday — found that posture improved and neck tension reduced by the end of the day.

If you’d like, I can also add **a quick ergonomic desk setup diagram** so this file is visual and ready to share as part of your internship milestone submission. That would make it even more practical. Would you like me to do that?
