# Agile Team Roles – Research & Reflection

## 1. Research & Learn

### Key Roles in an Agile Team

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **Developers** | Build and deliver product features, fix bugs, ensure code quality, and collaborate with other roles to meet acceptance criteria. |
| **QA (Quality Assurance)** | Test new features, verify bug fixes, ensure quality standards, and prevent defects from reaching users. |
| **Product Manager (PM)** | Own the product vision, prioritise features, manage backlog, and align the team’s work with business and customer needs. |
| **Agile Project Manager (Agile PM)** | Facilitate Agile processes, remove blockers, manage timelines, track progress, and support team productivity. |
| **UX / UI Designers** | Design user interfaces, conduct user research, and ensure the product is intuitive and accessible. |
| **Customer Support** | Collect feedback from users, report bugs, and ensure customer needs are heard and prioritised. |
| **Stakeholders** | Provide business context, funding, and strategic direction; review progress and outcomes. |

### Collaboration in Kanban vs Scrum
- **Scrum:** Roles often work within structured ceremonies (e.g., sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, retrospectives). Work is planned and fixed for the sprint duration.
- **Kanban:** Collaboration happens continuously—roles update the board in real-time, pull work when ready, and adjust priorities as needed without waiting for sprint boundaries.

## 2. Reflection

### My Role (Finance Intern) in the Agile Process
I contribute by:
- Providing **financial analysis** that informs business and product decisions.
- Tracking budgets and costs related to product features, marketing, or grants.
- Supporting the team with **data for prioritisation** (e.g., ROI, funding opportunities).
- Keeping finance tasks visible on the Kanban board so progress is transparent.

### How My Responsibilities Interact with Other Roles
- **Product Manager:** I supply cost estimates, ROI analysis, and funding constraints so they can prioritise features realistically.
- **Developers/Other Roles:** My work indirectly affects resource allocation and timelines by ensuring budget feasibility.

## 3. Task

### Role Fit in the Agile Team
As a Finance Intern, I act as a **data and insights provider**—turning raw numbers into actionable information that helps the team make better strategic and operational decisions.

### Role I Frequently Collaborate With & How to Improve Teamwork
- **Collaboration Partner:** Product Manager  
- **Improvement Plan:** Schedule short weekly syncs to align on upcoming priorities, share quick finance snapshots, and proactively flag any budget risks that might affect planned features.

If you’d like, I can also prepare a **Kanban-specific workflow map** showing how Finance interacts with PM, Dev, and QA so it’s easier to visualise your place in the team. Want me to create that?
